Development and Validation of Automated Quality Assurance Algorithms for PET/CT Imaging Repositories

## Project Title
Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre Industry Project 

## Description
This project aims to develop and validate automated quality assurance (QA) algorithms to assess the completeness and features of PET/CT imaging data within a multi-centre cancer imaging repository. Leveraging open-source tools and deep learning-based organ segmentation models, the project will create a QA pipeline within a Jupyter Notebook environment. Tasks including conducting a comparative analysis of existing tools and benchmarking them against gold-standard labels for scan range and image quality. The initiative will support data integrity in large-scale imaging repositories and contribute to open-source QA methodologies.

## Data
The data is too big that can not push to github, hence we put the manifest tcia format Guide script (located in data folder) file instead. You can use the [NBIA Data Retriever](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/NBIA/Downloading+TCIA+Images) to obtain the datasets.
